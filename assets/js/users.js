  `My name is Violet, and I am six years old. For the past few months I have been having severe stomach aches, and eventually found out I had a tumor as big as my fist, near my kidney. I was diagnosis with Stage 4 neuroblastoma. All over my body was exposed to the cancer. I was quickly admitted into Lady Cilento Hospital, Brisbane. I lost my ability to walk, and quickly went through heavy chemo. I had a surgery to remove most of the tumor, and am currently goring through radiation.`,
